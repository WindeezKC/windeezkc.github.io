			<h2>Bring Your Own Box</h2>
			<p>
              
                    The purpose of this assignment was to create a box that you can either 3D print, Laser Cut or&nbsp; CNC out a Box and a lid.
                Something that could hold all the parts to the class such as Breadboards, wires,&nbsp; resistors, and any other small electronic component.
                Starting off was choosing the form to use, having some CAD experience and &nbsp;being very familiar with FDM 3D printers for the past 12 years. I chose to 3D print my box. 
                Design was simple, make it big enough so it can hold everything &nbsp;but also have the room to add compartments 
                
                
            
            

                Starting with the design process started with figuring out the dimensions needed, As i wanted a compartment to be jsut for the Breadboards, looking up their dimensions and seeing they are roughly 55mm in width and 
                170mm in length I knew a box would need at least a width of 170mm so why not make it an even 200mm. The length was thrown in at 190mm to to draw the compartments inside those dimensions
                splitting them at 70mm from the edge, 60mm from that and then to the last wall. along with a smaller compartment to house just the random leds and smaller bits in its own 5cmx5cm box. 
                This sketch ends up looking like a mess with adding a notch to have the id snap into and another notch to cut away at the box so you can get your fingers underneath the lid.
                
                <div>
                <img src="imgs/box-plan1.png" />
                </div>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
            As you can see, the multiple squares and rectangles end up coming together and creating segments in Fusion 360 for you to use. I then took these segments and decided on a height of 60mm so even a 
            breadboard could lay on its side inside the container if needed and then extruded it out. This creates something a little more physical looking than just a bunch of random sketches in
            Fusion 360. With the height of 60mm we needed the inside compartments to be slightly lower than this so the lid would not run into issues as I was going for a snap tight lid with an edge.
            This made me make the inside compartment walls on 55mm in height overall so there was a 5 mm difference between the outside edge versus compartment walls. With all the dimensions decided on
            and acocounted for this sketch then turns into what looks like this.
            
            <div>
            <img src="imgs/box-plan2.png"/>
                </div>
                </p>

                <p>
                    
            With something more physical now it was time to print this and convert it to an STL. Doing this then printing it and waiting the near 24 hrs it took to print after deciding
            on a wall thickness of 1mm and infill thickness of 20% to keep the rigidity while also allowing a print time to be reasoanble with a layer height of .2 mm as it keeps structure and binds well together
            you now have a physical object that you can hold. Going from the sketch and model it now turns into an object you can actually pick up, play with and hold in your hands.
           
           
            <div>
            <img id= "vertical" src = "imgs/box-image0.jpeg"/>
                </div>
            </p>


            <p>
                From here we now have the physical box , using the same steps as before we make a lid in Fusion 360 based on the 190mm by 200mm dimensions and where the notch is inside the box &nbsp; we place 
                a cutout in the box at 100mm where the notch is and make a square and round that square off and cut away from the lid to make a 1mm x 1mm hole in the lid so it can stay and snap in&nbsp; place.
                After printing this out we have a lid and box that has a few compartments for everything and will store it safely. &nbsp;

                <div>
                    <img id = "vertical" src="imgs/box-image3.jpeg">
                        </div>
                        </p>
            </p>
            

           <p>
            After all said and done, we now have a box that can house the Breadboards, resistors, wires, LEDs and smaller electronic componenets by using Fusion 360 and some quick measurements.
